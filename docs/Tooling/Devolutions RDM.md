# Devolutions Remote Desktop Manager

My chosen remote access tool, it has too many options to list, take a look at the link [here](https://devolutions.net/).

Click [here for a direct link](https://devolutions.net/remote-desktop-manager) to the Remote Desktop Connection manger. The tool will host all sorts of connections, not just RDP.

## Noteable abilities (free version)

- RDP connection management.
- Password Management.
- Cross-platform.

The paid for version supports installing a central database on a local server to be shared by endusers, with role based access and reporting.

## Setup

1. Download the app from the website.
2. Install it, upon first run you'll need to setup an account.
4. To add your first RDP connection, right-click on the  top of the navigation bar on the left-left hand side.
5. Click new entry.

You're off and ready to go.
