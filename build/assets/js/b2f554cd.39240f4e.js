Firstly you need to get your team on board with this approach, which can present its own challenge.\\n\\n## Pros and Cons of the Automation Approach\\n\\nI may well be a little biased here but, in my experience, if the status quo is to prefer manual tasks. It will be hard going initially to get others to see the light that is automating away \\"their\\" jobs. I use quote marks there because, the typical Infrastructure role is changing rapidly.\\n\\n### Pros\\n\\n- Reduce time to perform an action.\\n- Reduce risk in performing the action.\\n- Freeing up staff from the burden of manual tasks.\\n- Standardisation of tasks.\\n\\n### Cons\\n\\n- Time consuming to implement in the first instance.\\n- Staff need training on the automation methods.\\n- You may encounter resistance when it comes to changing the status quo.\\n\\n## Tools at your disposal\\n\\nA very brief overview of the various tools that can be used, my first suggestion is to investigate the use of PowerShell and RunBooks; they\'ve always seemed to make the most sense to start with.\\n\\n### PowerShell\\n\\nThis is an incredibly versatile tool that can be used to manage almost any resource on-prem and in the cloud. I\'d suggest digging into the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/) and also familiarising yourself with the Office 365 modules too ([SharePoint Online](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/sharepoint/?view=sharepoint-ps), [Exchange Online](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/exchange-online-powershell-v2?view=exchange-ps), [Microsoft Teams](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/teams-powershell-overview), [Azure Active Directory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/active-directory/overview?view=azureadps-2.0), more in-depth KBs and posts to follow on these.\\n\\nYou aren\'t just restricted to using PowerShell from your machine running the Windows OS, you can also use an Automation Account with a PowerShell runbook, I\'ll upload a KB to get you started soon!\\n\\nLearn more about PowerShell [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7.3).\\n\\n### Azure Bicep\\n\\nBicep is a declarative language, used to deploy Azure resources. In a Bicep file, you define what you want to deploy to Azure and then use that file to repeatedly deploy your infrastructure. It\'s a great tool to ensure consistency in your environments although, this is a separate language to learn and only applies to Azure.\\n\\nYou can learn more about Bicep [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview?tabs=bicep).\\n\\n### Azure Logic Apps\\n\\nLogic Apps is a cloud platform\\\\service where you can create and run workflows in Azure (there\'s an Office 365 version with a cut-down toolset called Power Automate which is also really good). The major plus of using these is that they require little to no code at all to set up, it\'s all visual.\\n\\nLogic Apps integrate with most Office 365 and Azure services making them versatile, easy to maintain and accessible to people with less knowledge of coding.\\n\\nLearn more about Logic Apps [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-overview).\\n\\nThanks for reading!\\n\\nI hope that gives you some idea of what options there are for automation in Azure, I\'ll be following up with another post of suggested processes you can automate both from suggestions online and from my experience."},{"id":"Azure Permission & Resource Management","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Azure Permission & Resource Management","source":"@site/blog/Azure Permission & Resource Management.md","title":"Azure Permission & Resource Management","description":"Something that can be quite annoying to grasp are the varying permission levels and roles involved in the Microsoft Cloud platforms.","date":"2023-01-03T13:18:40.000Z","formattedDate":"January 3, 2023","tags":[{"label":"KB","permalink":"/blog/tags/kb"},{"label":"Azure","permalink":"/blog/tags/azure"},{"label":"Permissions","permalink":"/blog/tags/permissions"}],"readingTime":3.21,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"itjamm"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"Azure Permission & Resource Management","title":"Azure Permission & Resource Management","author":"itjamm","tags":["KB","Azure","Permissions"]},"prevItem":{"title":"What is Automation in Azure?","permalink":"/blog/What is Automation in Azure"}},"content":"Something that can be quite annoying to grasp are the varying permission levels and roles involved in the Microsoft Cloud platforms.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\nFor the most part, us techies will learn from the group up starting from on-prem NTFS\\\\Share permissions, to have then to learn Office 365 roles.\\n\\nNow we\'ve got those two down, time to shove another layer on top which is the permissions inside Azure, hopefully the below can simplify this for you.\\n\\n## The 4 management levels\\n\\nThe below is nothing original by the way, I\'ve lifted it and re-written the concepts into another format from a Microsoft docs article here, you may prefer their version.\\n\\n[Organize your Azure resources effectively](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-setup-guide/organize-resources)\\n\\n**Management group**s help to manage access via policy and compliance over multiple subscriptions. When a subscription is part of a management group, it\'ll automatically inherit all conditionas\\\\settings setup in the management group.\\n\\n**Subscriptions** logically associate permissions with resources they create. Each individual subscription has limits\\\\quotas regarding the amount of resources it can create\\\\use. Subscriptions also help to organise costs.\\n\\n**Resource Groups** are logical containers, where you can deploy Azure resources to; you could think of them being along the lines of Folders. You can also apply tags to help better manage resources and what they\'re for.\\n\\n**Resources** are instances of services that you can create.\\n\\n## Managing Access to resources\\n\\nWe should always plan for the least privileges required to allow a team to work, the permission model in Azure is designed to allow this however, I\'d say it is so granular that it generates more work that necessary in most cases.\\n\\nHere\'s a basic list from my experience setting up a permission model in the past; it covers a service desk team.\\n\\n- Call Agent team - No access to Azure resources.\\n- Level 1, 2 and 3 teams - Reader access at the Subscription level, providing Contributor role at the Resource Group or Resource level where appropriate.\\n- Infrastructure - If the team also performs security functions, I would suggest the Contributor role be assigned of at the Subscription Level where appropriate and to assign the Owner role at the resource group level where the Infrastructure they \\"own\\" is situated.\\n\\nPermission elevation controls and experience levels should be taken into account. In previous companies, I\'d trust the L2 team to have the same access as L3 and, in some cases I\'d not even consider it!\\n\\nYou can also control Service Desk team access using Change Control. Asking them to justify their access requirements via a change process not only allows others to check what they\'re doing, it could also show that they do not need to access rights in the first place.\\n\\nSpeaking from experience, I\'d highly recommend trusting your Infrastructure team to have the Contributor role at the Subscription level where possible. It will make a lot of difference to all teams \\"quality of life\\" if they\'ve access to someone who can carry out actions they cannot.\\n\\n## Resource tagging\\n\\nTags can be an absolute godsent and can help you to quickly identify your resources and resource groups. You apply tags to your Azure resources and resource groups to logically organize them into categories.  \\n\\nTags can include context about the resource\'s associated workload or application, operational requirements, and ownership information.\\n\\nSome suggested uses for tags;\\n**Metadata and documentation**, Admins can apply a tag to all resources matching a specific workload or project.\\n**Automation**, you can target a tag for scripts etc.\\n**Cost analysis**, this is the most common use case that I\'ve come across for tags.\\n\\nEach resource or resource group can have a maximum of 50 tag name and value pairs. This limitation only applies to tags directly applied to the resource group or resource.\\n\\nThat turned out to be a little longer than I\'d hoped for, with any luck it\'ll be of some use."}]}')}}]);
