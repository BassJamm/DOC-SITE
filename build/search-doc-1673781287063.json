Try to split the jobs based on size being backed up. An example of a suggestion below. Create a single job to capture anything that is new.If you've got loads of small SharePoint sites, split them into chunks as these will take a long time to backup. A few thousand of these will take hours to backup. For example, take the largest 10 sites and put them in their own jobs.The SharePoint backup job will also back personal sites as well, no need to include the personal sites in the other jobs.

Next, you give the resource a symbolic name. In the example, the resource's symbolic name is storageAccount. info Symbolic names are used within Bicep to refer to the resource, but they won't ever show up in Azure. Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2022-09-01 is the resource type and API version of the resource. Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts tells Bicep that you're declaring an Azure storage account. The date 2022-09-01 is the version of the Azure Storage API that Bicep uses when it creates the resource. You have to declare a resource name, which is the name the storage account will be assigned in Azure. You'll set a resource name using the name keyword. caution Resource names often have rules you must follow, like maximum lengths, allowed characters, and uniqueness across all of Azure. The requirements for resource names are different for each Azure resource type. You'll then set other details of the resource, such as its location,SKU (pricing tier), and kind. In this example, we're setting the storage account's access tier to Hot. tip There are also properties you can define that are different for each resource type. Different API versions might introduce different properties, too. "},{"title":"Resource Dependancies​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Bicep CheatSheet","url":"/CheatSheets/Bicep/Building your first template/Defining Resources#resource-dependancies","content":"You might have to extract some information from one resource to be able to define another. Or, if you're deploying a web application, you'll have to create the server infrastructure before you can add an application to it. These relationships are called dependencies. We need to deploy an App Service app for the template, before that can be done, we need to deploy an App Service Plan. Below we are deploying the App Service Plan. resource appServicePlan 'Microsoft.Web/serverFarms@2022-03-01' = { name: 'toy-product-launch-plan' location: 'westus3' sku: { name: 'F1' } }  Above we are deploying an App Service plan that has the resource type Microsoft.Web/serverFarms. The plan resource is named toy-product-launch-plan, and it's deployed into the West US 3 region. It uses a pricing SKU of F1, which is the free tier of App Service. Next, we must declare the App itself. resource appServiceApp 'Microsoft.Web/sites@2022-03-01' = { name: 'toy-product-launch-1' location: 'westus3' properties: { serverFarmId: appServicePlan.id httpsOnly: true } }  This template instructs Azure to host the app on the plan we just created. Notice that the definition of the plan includes the symbolic name of the App Service plan on this line: serverFarmId: appServicePlan.id. This line means that Bicep will get the App Service plan's resource ID using the id property. It's effectively saying, this app's server farm ID is the ID of the App Service plan defined earlier. tip In Azure, a resource ID is a unique identifier for each resource. The resource ID includes the Azure subscription ID, the resource group name, and the resource name, along with some other information. By declaring the app resource with a property that references the symbolic name of the plan, Azure understands the implicit dependency between the App Service app and the plan.

You can also create a parameter file, which lists all of the parameters and values they want to use for the deployment. Variables let you store important information in one place and refer to it throughout the template without having to copy and paste it. It's usually a good idea to use parameters for things that will change between each deployment, like: The names of resources that need to be unique.Locations into which to deploy the resources.Settings that affect the pricing of resources, like their SKUs, pricing tiers, and instance counts.Credentials and information needed to access other systems that aren't defined in the template.

Bicep can determine the type based on the value that you set. "},{"title":"Expressions​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Deploying Resources","url":"/CheatSheets/Bicep/Building your first template/Deploying Resources#expressions","content":"When you're writing templates, you often don't want to hard-code values, or even ask for them to be specified in a parameter. Instead, you want to discover values when the template runs. For example, you might want to automatically create a unique name for a resource based on a particular naming strategy your company uses. Resource locations​ In Bicep, you can create a parameter called location, then use an expression to set its value: param location string = resourceGroup().location  It uses a function called resourceGroup() that gives you access to information about the resource group the template is being deployed into. In this example, the template uses the location property. It's common to use this approach to deploy your resources into the same Azure region as the resource group. resource appServiceApp 'Microsoft.Web/sites@2022-03-01' = { name: appServiceAppName location: location properties: { serverFarmId: appServicePlan.id httpsOnly: true } }  Resource names​ Bicep has another function called uniqueString() that comes in handy when you're creating resource names. Let's look at how you might use the uniqueString() function: param storageAccountName string = uniqueString(resourceGroup().id)  This parameter's default value uses the resourceGroup() function again, like you did when you set the resource location. This time, though, you're getting the ID for a resource group. Here's what a resource group ID looks like: /subscriptions/3e57e557-826f-460b-8f1c-4ce38fd53b32/resourceGroups/MyResourceGroup  The resource group ID includes the Azure subscription ID (3e57e557-826f-460b-8f1c-4ce38fd53b32) and the resource group name (MyResourceGroup). The resource group ID is often a good candidate for a seed value for resource names, because: Every time you deploy the same resources, they'll go into the same resource group. The uniqueString() function will return the same value every time. If you deploy into two different resource groups in the Azure subscription, the resourceGroup().id value will be different, because the resource group names will be different. The uniqueString() function will give different values for each set of resources. If you deploy into two different Azure subscriptions, even if you use the same resource group name, the resourceGroup().id value will be different because the Azure subscription ID will be different. The uniqueString() function will again give different values for each set of resources. Combined strings​ Bicep has a feature called string interpolation that lets you combine strings. Let's see how it works: param storageAccountName string = 'toylaunch${uniqueString(resourceGroup().id)}'  The default value for the storageAccountName parameter now has two parts to it: toylaunch is a hard-coded string that helps anyone who looks at the deployed resource in Azure to understand what the storage account's purpose.${uniqueString(resourceGroup().id)} is a way of telling Bicep to evaluate the output of the uniqueString(resourceGroup().id) function, then concatenate it into the string. Selecting SKUs for resources​ You want to make sure you don't spend too much money on your non-production environments. So you decide on some policies: In production environments, storage accounts will be deployed at the Standard_GRS (geo-redundant storage) SKU for high resiliency. App Service plans will be deployed at the P2v3 SKU for high performance.In non-production environments, storage accounts will be deployed at the Standard_LRS (locally redundant storage) SKU. App Service plans will be deployed at the free F1 SKU. First, you can specify a parameter that indicates whether the deployment is for a production or non-production environment: Notice that this code uses some new syntax to specify a list of allowed values for the environmentType parameter. @allowed([ 'nonprod' 'prod' ]) param environmentType string  Next, you can create variables that determine the SKUs to use for the storage account and App Service plan based on the environment: var storageAccountSkuName = (environmentType == 'prod') ? 'Standard_GRS' : 'Standard_LRS' var appServicePlanSkuName = (environmentType == 'prod') ? 'P2V3' : 'F1'  Notice some new syntax here, too. Let's break it down: (environmentType == 'prod') evaluates to a Boolean (true or false) value, depending on which allowed value is used for environmentType parameter.? is called a ternary operator and it evaluates an if/then statement. The value after the ? operator is used if the expression is true. If the expression evaluates to false, the value after the colon (:) is used. These rules can be translated to: For the storageAccountSkuName variable, if the environmentType parameter is set to prod, then use the Standard_GRS SKU. Otherwise, use the Standard_LRS SKU.For the appServicePlanSkuName variable, if the environmentType parameter is set to prod, then use the P2V3 SKU and the PremiumV3 tier. Otherwise, use the F1 SKU.
